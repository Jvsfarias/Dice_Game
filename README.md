# Dice_Game
That's my second project using JavaScript... I got HTML and CSS files from a course that i'am watching, and i did JavaScript part by my own..! Hope you like it &lt;3

Rules: Each player can roll the dice as many times as they want adding up the points obtained, however if you get '1' you loose all points goted and the turn pass to another. If the player who are in turn click on "Hold", the points that you got before appearing '1', are added to the actual score and the player ensure them. The game ends when one of the players reach 100 points.
